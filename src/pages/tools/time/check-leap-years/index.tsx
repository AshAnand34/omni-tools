      "One of our friends was born on a leap year on February 29th and as a consequence, she has a birthday only once every 4 years. As we can never really remember when her birthday is, we are using our program to create a reminder list of the upcoming leap years. To create a list of her next birthdays, we load a sequence of years from 2025 to 2040 into the input and get the status of each year. If the program says that it's a leap year, then we know that we'll be invited to a birthday party on February 29th.",
